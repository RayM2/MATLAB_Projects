Anything in which I have utilized MATLAB

Project 1: Differential Equations Class 
1. Find the solution of a second order differential equation
2. Rewrite the solution y as a system of equations x1 and x2
3. Utilize Euler's Method to solve for x1 and x2
4. Calculate the error for h=pi/50, pi/100, and pi/200 and plot an error table
5. Using pi/200, plot the trajectory in the (x1,x2) plane, where x1 and x2 are numerical solution vectors
6. Repeat the solution and error table using the Runge-Kutta Method
